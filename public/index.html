                    I received a job
                    offer mid-course,
                    and the
                    subjects I
                    learned
                    were
                    current, if not more
                    so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

                <p class=" text-base opacity-70 xl:text-[16px] 2xl:text-[20px] 2xl:leading-6">"I was an EMT for many
                    years before I
                    joined
                    the bootcamp. I've been
                    looking to make
                    a
                    transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free
                    intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the
                    best and most grueling-time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched
                    careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

                    "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
                    professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                    student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
                    staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
                    agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way
                    that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example
                    of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after
                    receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
